After his graduation Evan returned to NYC where he became Controller of Maraolo Italian Leather Shoes &amp; Accessories, an international chain with 9 locations spread across NYC, Florida, and California. Evan quickly became Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in just nine months and since then has accumulated enriching experiences as a CFO for various companies such as Biscuits &amp; Bath, Communication Services for the Deaf (CSD), and Liberty Enterprises.</p> <p>While working for CSD, Evan acquired a FedEx Home delivery operation in Minnesota, and started AZS Express Shakopee, Inc. After starting with 3 full time employees and 5 vehicles, the business has grown to 25+ full time employees and 40+ vehicles. Evan also returned to RIT and became a member of the first ever Online Executive MBA program in the United States, a crowning achievement for both RIT and Evan. This class started with 13 students and resulted in only 5 graduates. The program was invaluable in helping shape Evan’s vision for the future from not only the program itself, but also through visiting Prague and collaborating with numerous large companies in Prague.</p> <p>Evan eventually he met his wife Jerilyn and now they have two kids Sean and Alyssa and reside in Austin, Texas. During Evan’s free time he enjoys spending time with his family, traveling, and watching his favorite sports teams (Knicks, Jets, Yankees – he is a NYC boy after all!) while continuing to learn more about our community and how to help the community grow.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=staff__container> <div class=staff__item> <div class='staff__item--image staff__jarrod'></div> </div> <div class='staff__item staff__item--text--container'> <div class=staff__item--text> <figcaption>Jarrod Musano</figcaption> <p>Early in Jarrod’s career he held numerous construction jobs which provided him with valuable life experience. Jarrod was involved with various areas of construction including but not limited to building infrastructure, utilities, and exterior modification. Jarrod learned that understanding the logistical issues and limitations that go along with implementing these types of projects were extremely important and since then has honed these skills through various positions.</p> <p>In 1998 Jarrod became CEO of Liberty Enterprises, a property management company in New York City. Jarrod oversees all construction-related improvements/repairs as well as directs regulations on billings, rental prices, and legal affairs. Jarrod is also responsible for maintaining the life and growth of the company, acquiring properties and securing future projects.</p> <p>Jarrod also has experience with start-up companies as he is successfully leading four start-ups: RentManhattan, Infini Maintenance, Ibuilding Networks, and Convo Communications. Jarrod is responsible for deriving and implementing visionary strategic plans for these companies. Jarrod is especially proud of his role as CEO of Convo Communications as it’s a mixture of two areas he’s very passionate about: technology and communications. Using technology to raise the bar with how people communicate with each other is the future and Jarrod is immersed in maximizing this strategy.</p> <p>Jarrod also currently serves on the Mark Seven Deaf Foundation Board and hopes to start a new charter school in NYC in the near future. Jarrod spends his free time with his three boys Rohan, Gray, and Benjamin. Jarrod enjoys traveling around the world and is an avid fan of the New York Giants where he has season tickets and brings his boys with him to the games.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class='small-12 columns'> <blockquote class=is__text--centered>So now you've met us.
